                    Creating a website provided the best platform for expressing my argument due to its ability to reach wide audiences, integrate multimedia elements, and offer an interactive experience. The decision to use a website stemmed from the idea of supplementing my relatively writing-heavy project with media elements. <br></p><p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    The multifaceted and digital nature of blockchain deemed the use of a medium that combines visual and auditory elements. Websites allow for integration of videos, images, audio clips, and interactive features, enabling an immersive experience. In contrast to an essay, a website offers a familiar and pertinent space to allow viewers to engage with my arguments. <br></p><p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    The creation of my website involved a process beginning with conceptualizing my idea, outlining the concepts into writing, and supplementing the concepts with multimedia elements. To maintain a cohesive narrative, I organized my content into sections flowing from one to the next. Using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript I created a visually engaging layout that enhances my writing. In addition, I used responsive design to ensure accessibility on nearly all devices which increases the reach and inclusivity. <br></p><p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    The aim of my project is to spread awareness about the environmental impact of blockchain technology, especially ones using Proof of Work consensus systems. By using a platform that transcends geographical boundaries, I hope to reach and inform many viewers across the world and inspire conversation and discussion about blockchain and new technologies in general. <br></p><p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    The decision to express my ideas through a website comes from a desire to embrace the versatility and accessibility of the internet and web design. The process involved a fusion of conceptualization, design, coding, and writing, resulting in an immersive online experience. I hope my project sparks meaningful conversation, resonates with a wide audience, and contributes to broader discussion on the environmental impacts of blockchain technology.
