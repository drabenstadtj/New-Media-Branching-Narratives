      <h5><b>Artist's Statement</b></h5>
      <p>
        In the evolving landscape of storytelling, a revolution unfolds within
        the dynamic realm of video games. For decades, this transformative era
        has been marked by interactive experiences that redefine the
        conventional boundaries of traditional media forms, transcending the
        linear constraints of cinema. It is within this context that I found the
        creation of a webpage to be the most effective medium for expressing my
        argument, much like the immersive narratives found in video games.
      </p>

      <p>
        My decision to utilize a website for my argument stems from my desire to
        utilize its multifaceted and interactive nature, like video games. In a
        similar way to video games’ integration of visuals, audio, and player
        agency, a webpage allows for an incorporation of videos, images, audio,
        and interactive features. This fusion of elements creates an immersive
        experience surpassing the limitations of essays and articles.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept of my website began with the construction of my argument.
        Video games are something I feel strongly about in their power as
        storytelling tools, and I find them unlike any other medium. Thanks to
        this, the argument I would make became clear. Following the construction
        of my argument, I planned the layout of my site. I wanted to create a
        layout that facilitated a linear flow and engaged readers. These factors
        lead me to create a next and previous navigation button to navigate the
        different pages. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and minor JavaScript, I created a
        simple layout, allowing multimedia elements and writing to speak for
        themselves. I worked to make the design responsive and able to be read
        on a breadth of screen sizes, expanding the reach of my argument. This
        approach utilizes the versatility of markup languages and the reach of
        the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to these goals, I attempted to improve upon my last
        implementation of a webpage for project #3. I used the same multimedia
        aspects to engage viewers with the addition of a quiz aspect, with the
        goal of making readers think further about the topics I cover. Also, I
        introduced visitors to the layout of the page and what the goal of the
        site is on the home page.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the same way video games redefine storytelling, webpages challenge
        traditional communication mediums. The integration of multimedia
        elements, coupled with interactive design, transforms my argument into
        an immersive experience. My hope is that this project sparks
        conversation and the recognition of video games as an unparalleled
        unique storytelling tool thanks to the mediums engaging properties.
