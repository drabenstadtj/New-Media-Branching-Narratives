      <h5><b>Introduction</b></h5>
      <p>
        In the vast realm of storytelling, a revolution has been unfolding
        within the interactive universe of video games for decades. This
        revolution has been marked by an era where interactive experiences
        redefine the boundaries of traditional media forms such as books and
        films. These digital narratives, characterized by branching stories,
        player agency, and dynamic storytelling, carve out a unique space that
        diverges from the straightforward paths of traditional films.

        Video games, traditionally viewed as mere entertainment, unveil a
        narrative depth that challenges preconceived notions of their narrative
        depth. I aim to uncover what sets video game narratives and storytelling
        apart. In video games, the choices you make direct the storyline, making
        players more than onlookers but active contributors to the unfolding
        stories. This essence defines video game storytelling, a path shaped by
        player decisions and intricate narratives that extend beyond the
        scripted lines of cinematic storytelling.

        <blockquote>
          "The arousal is not only derived from input but also experienced in
          relation to processing the input in a more profound way than just
          guessing the probable outcome. The player participates in a virtual
          reality simulation of a possible real world" (Zillmann & Vorderer,
          1990, p. 203).

        Video games introduce a level of interactivity and agency that elevates
        storytelling to a participatory and dynamic experience. Itâ€™s a form of
        narrative that challenges conventional storytelling norms, inviting
        players to engage with and contribute to the stories they experience. As
        we delve deeper into this exploration, we uncover a new frontier in
        storytelling, where the boundaries of authorship blur, and the narrative
        becomes a collaborative venture between the creators and the players.
