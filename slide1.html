      <h5><b>Player Choices in Action</b></h5>
      <p>
        In the video game Until Dawn, players are confronted with a pivotal
        moment that demonstrates the essence of interactive storytelling. One of
        the defining choices of the game occurs when the player is confronted
        with a lever. Pulling it one way results in the demise of Ashley, while
        the other way results in the killing of Josh.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player's decision at this juncture not only determines the immediate
        fate of the characters but also sends ripples through the storyline,
        unveiling the complexity inherent in video game narratives. Opting to
        save Ashley, Josh appears to be graphically killed by the saw; however,
        it is later revealed that Josh had planned the encounter, and his body
        was a false body. Opting to save Josh, the saw approaches Ashley but
        stops just in time, leaving Ashley alive. In both situations, there are
        possibilities of them both being killed in the future.

      <p>
        As players grapple with decisions like choosing between Ashley and Josh,
        they become unwitting architects of the unfolding narrative. The impact
        of these choices extends beyond immediate outcomes, creating a dynamic
        and branching storyline where every decision adds a layer of complexity.
        This ripple effect challenges the linear structure of cinematic
        storytelling, introducing unpredictability and replayability that keeps
        them engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the collaborative nature of video game storytelling is
        accentuated in the design of these narrative experiences. Game designers
        craft decision points, character arcs, and plot twists, laying the
        foundation and basis for a compelling story. Here, the collaborative
        venture unfolds, as the creators design a scenario where the choices
        appear to lead to irrevocable consequences, fostering a sense of agency
        for players and bringing weight to every decision. However, behind the
        scenes, the narrative is designed to pivot and reveal the true nature of
        these consequences, creating a dynamic and unexpected turn of events.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this manipulation of player perception, the collaborative nature of
        game storytelling is revealed. The creators set the stage for players to
        contribute to the narrative not only through their choices but also
        through their emotional reactions and interpretations. Players believe
        they are shaping the story in one direction, only to later realize the
        narrative has been orchestrated in another way.
      </p>
      <p>
        These collaborative deceptions and pivotal player decisions challenge
        the conventional boundaries of cinematic storytelling and transform the
        player from a passive participant into an active contributor to the
        narrative. The collaboration between creator and player in Until Dawn
        goes both ways, with the creators crafting a narrative that toys with
        expectations, and in turn, players contribute to the story through their
        emotional investment and interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout many different video game narratives, this collaborative
        interaction between creators and players emerges as a crucial part of
        the medium. It highlights the malleability of storytelling in video
        games, where the narrative can twist and turn in unexpected directions,
        revealing a shared journey where both creators and players actively
        shape the narrative experience.
