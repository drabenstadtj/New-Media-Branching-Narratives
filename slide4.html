      <h5><b>Conclusions</b></h5>
      <p>
        Video games have undergone a transformation in terms of their
        storytelling marked by branching narratives, player agency, and dynamic
        storytelling. This transformation has challenged established norms of
        traditional media forms such as movies, television, and literature.
        Video games have historically been dismissed as simply entertainment;
        however, they utilize a narrative depth that defies these notions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The heart of video game storytelling lies in the hands of players, where
        choices made become pivotal in shaping the unfolding narratives. This
        interactivity and agency elevate storytelling to a participatory and
        dynamic experience, challenging the linear structure of cinematic
        storytelling. As players grapple with decisions that send ripples
        through the following storyline, the complexity inherent in video game
        narratives becomes apparent, introducing unpredictability and
        replayability.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, the collaborative nature of video game storytelling emerges
        as a crucial aspect of the medium. Game designers craft scenarios where
        player choices appear to lead to consequences, fostering agency.
        However, within this, the narrative has been designed to pivot by game
        creators, creating dynamic and unexpected turns of events. This
        manipulation of player perception reveals a collaboration between
        players and creators, where both are actively contributing to the
        narrative experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The case study of Until Dawn exemplifies this collaborative venture,
        where creators craft a narrative that toys with expectations, and
        players, in turn, contribute through emotional investment and
        interpretations. Through various video game narratives, this
        collaboration proves an integral part of the medium as it evolves,
        highlighting its malleability in storytelling. The narrative can change
        in unexpected directions, unveiling a shared journey where creators and
        players actively shape the storytelling experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Video games redefine the storytelling landscape, offering a unique and
        collaborative form of narrative art that surpasses the linear
        constraints of cinema as a medium. As games evolve, the boundaries of
        authorship blur, and storytelling becomes a shared venture between the
        creators and players, forging a new path in the art of narratives.
