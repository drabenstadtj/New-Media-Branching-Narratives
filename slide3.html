      <h5><b>Quiz Recap</b></h5>
      <p>
        <strong>1. What sets video game narratives apart from films?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Video game narratives distinguish themselves from films through their
        dynamic storytelling and emphasis on player choices. While films follow
        a linear and predetermined storyline, video games introduce an
        interactive element where players actively participate in shaping the
        narrative. The inclusion of explosive action scenes and renowned actors
        might be shared features, but the defining characteristic lies in the
        player's ability to influence the direction of the story. This
        interactive storytelling sets video games apart, offering a level of
        engagement and agency not found in traditional cinematic experiences.
      </p>

      <p><strong>2. How do players impact video game stories?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Players wield a significant influence over video game stories through
        their choices and actions. In contrast to a passive viewing experience,
        gamers actively engage with the narrative by making decisions that lead
        to different outcomes. The storyline becomes malleable, adapting to the
        choices players make during gameplay. This dynamic interaction creates a
        personalized experience, where the player's decisions shape not only the
        plot but also the emotional tone and overall direction of the game's
        narrative. It's this active involvement that distinguishes video game
        storytelling from the more passive nature of film narratives.
      </p>

      <p><strong>3. What's "narrative exploration" in video games?</strong></p>
      <p>
        "Narrative exploration" in video games refers to the player's engagement
        with the storyline beyond the main quest. It involves actively seeking
        and uncovering hidden stories, quests, and details within the game
        world. Unlike sticking solely to the main plot, narrative exploration
        encourages players to delve into the game's lore, discover side quests,
        and interact with non-playable characters to unveil additional layers of
        the narrative. This aspect enhances the depth of the gaming experience,
        allowing players to contribute to their understanding of the story and
        immerse themselves more fully in the game world.
